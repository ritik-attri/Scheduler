This API creates a task with a specific date-time and takes an url.
Then it checks the date-time on the column with the system data-time and accordingly sends a request.

Few important things:
Date-time format:- 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'
You can use the postman collection I have shared to easily use the API.
If you still have any problem, go through the screenshots.
